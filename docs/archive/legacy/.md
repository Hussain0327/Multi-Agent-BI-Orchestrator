  Introducing DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp
 Introducing DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp — our latest experimental model!

 Built on V3.1-Terminus, it debuts DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) for faster, more efficient training & inference on long context.

 Now live on App, Web, and API

 API prices cut by 50%+!

 Efficiency Gains
 DSA achieves fine-grained sparse attention with minimal impact on output quality — boosting long-context performance & reducing compute cost.

 Benchmarks show V3.2-Exp performs on par with V3.1-Terminus.




Your First API Call
The DeepSeek API uses an API format compatible with OpenAI. By modifying the configuration, you can use the OpenAI SDK or softwares compatible with the OpenAI API to access the DeepSeek API.

PARAM	VALUE
base_url *       	https://api.deepseek.com
api_key	apply for an API key
* To be compatible with OpenAI, you can also use https://api.deepseek.com/v1 as the base_url. But note that the v1 here has NO relationship with the model's version.

* deepseek-chat and deepseek-reasoner are upgraded to DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp now. deepseek-chat is the non-thinking mode of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp and deepseek-reasoner is the thinking mode of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.

Invoke The Chat API
Once you have obtained an API key, you can access the DeepSeek API using the following example scripts. This is a non-stream example, you can set the stream parameter to true to get stream response.

curl
python
nodejs
curl https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-chat",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
        ],
        "stream": false
      }'



curl
python
nodejs
# Please install OpenAI SDK first: `pip3 install openai`
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get('DEEPSEEK_API_KEY'), base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-chat",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    ],
    stream=False
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
Models & Pricing
The prices listed below are in unites of per 1M tokens. A token, the smallest unit of text that the model recognizes, can be a word, a number, or even a punctuation mark. We will bill based on the total number of input and output tokens by the model.

1M OUTPUT TOKENS	$0.42
(1) If the request to the deepseek-reasoner model includes the tools parameter, the request will actually be processed using the deepseek-chat model.
Deduction Rules
The expense = number of tokens × price. The corresponding fees will be directly deducted from your topped-up balance or granted balance, with a preference for using the granted balance first when both balances are available.

Product prices may vary and DeepSeek reserves the right to adjust them. We recommend topping up based on your actual usage and regularly checking this page for the most recent pricing information.


The Temperature Parameter
The default value of temperature is 1.0.

We recommend users to set the temperature according to their use case listed in below.
USE CASE	TEMPERATURE
Coding / Math   	0.0
Data Cleaning / Data Analysis	1.0
General Conversation	1.3
Translation	1.3
Creative Writing / Poetry	1.5

Token & Token Usage
oken & Token Usage
Tokens are the basic units used by models to represent natural language text, and also the units we use for billing. They can be intuitively understood as 'characters' or 'words'. Typically, a Chinese word, an English word, a number, or a symbol is counted as a token.

Generally, the conversion ratio between tokens in the model and the number of characters is approximately as following:

1 English character ≈ 0.3 token.
1 Chinese character ≈ 0.6 token.
However, due to the different tokenization methods used by different models, the conversion ratios can vary. The actual number of tokens processed each time is based on the model's return, which you can view from the usage results.

Calculate token usage offline
You can run the demo tokenizer code in the following zip package to calculate the token usage for your intput/output.

Rate Limit
Rate Limit
DeepSeek API does NOT constrain user's rate limit. We will try out best to serve every request.

However, please note that when our servers are under high traffic pressure, your requests may take some time to receive a response from the server. During this period, your HTTP request will remain connected, and you may continuously receive contents in the following formats:

Non-streaming requests: Continuously return empty lines
Streaming requests: Continuously return SSE keep-alive comments (: keep-alive)
These contents do not affect the parsing of the JSON body by the OpenAI SDK. If you are parsing the HTTP responses yourself, please ensure to handle these empty lines or comments appropriately.

If the request is still not completed after 30 minutes, the server will close the connection.
